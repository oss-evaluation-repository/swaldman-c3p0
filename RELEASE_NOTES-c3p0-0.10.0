RELEASE NOTES, c3p0-0.10.0
==========================

This is a pretty major c3p0 release. (It should be. It's the first in... a while.)

Some highlights:

* c3p0 now sports a modern, automated mill build, which will render it much
  more appealing to incrementally maintain than its very manual 2002-era ant build

* Pluggable threading / thread pool, including support for delegating threading
  to existing Executors and Java 21 loom virtual threads

* Much simplified Connection testing by default, and simpler configuration of JDBC 6+
  timeout for Connection.isValid(...)

* c3p0 includes richer support for JDBC 4.3, including support for begin and end
  request methods

* Many, many small improvements and bug fixes.

Config parameters added:
------------------------
    attemptResurrectOnCheckin
    connectionIsValidTimeout
    taskRunnerFactoryClassName

Deprecated config parameter removed:
------------------------------------
    usesTraditionalReflectiveProxies
