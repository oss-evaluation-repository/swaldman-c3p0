RELEASE NOTES, c3p0-0.10.1
==========================

This is a minor c3p0 release, but includes some important fixes!
Thank to every one who reported issues.

Some highlights:

* Eliminates pinning within c3p0 proxies when clients are using loom virtual threads,
  as long the underlying JDBC driver avoids pinning.

* Fixes problems under Oracle drivers related to JDBC 4.3 beginRequest() / endRequest()
  hints when running under JDBC 4.2 / Java 8 or lower

* c3p0 statement caching is incompatible with certain drivers' handling of
  JDBC 4.3 beginRequest() / endRequest() hints. These drivers close() outstanding
  Statements when a session is reported completed (when endRequest() is called),
  destroying Statements which cached by c3p0 precisely to survive multiple sessions.
  To address this, and any other issues associated with driver handling of
  JDBC 4.3 beginRequest() / endRequest() hints, c3p0 adds a new config
  parameter -- markSessionBoundaries -- which may take values 'always',
  'never', or 'if-no-statement-cache'. See the documentation for more.

* Other more minor improvements and fixes.

Config parameters added:

Deprecated config parameter removed:
