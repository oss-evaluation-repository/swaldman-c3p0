RELEASE NOTES, c3p0-0.10.1
==========================

This is a minor c3p0 release, but includes some important fixes.
Thank to every one who reported issues.

Highlights:

* Eliminates pinning within c3p0 proxies when clients are using loom virtual threads,
  as long the underlying JDBC driver avoids pinning.

* Fixes problems under Oracle drivers related to JDBC 4.3 beginRequest() / endRequest()
  hints when running under JDBC 4.2 / Java 8 or lower

* Adds config parameter to disable JDBC 4.3 beginRequest() / endRequest() hints.
  Some JDBC drivers close() outstanding Statements when a session is reported completed
  (when endRequest() is called). This is incompatible with c3p0 statement caching, as
  the very purpose of that is to retain Statements through multiple sessions. To address
  this, and any other issues associated with driver handling of JDBC 4.3 beginRequest() /
  endRequest() hints, c3p0 adds a new config  parameter -- markSessionBoundaries -- which
  may take values 'always', 'never', or 'if-no-statement-cache'. See the documentation
  for more.

* Other more minor improvements and fixes.

Config parameters added:

Deprecated config parameter removed:
